        <main>Responsive web design is like a smart way of making websites. It makes sure that websites look good and work well on all kinds of devices, like phones, tablets, and computers. This is important because people use different devices to visit websites. Responsive design adjusts how things look and where they go on the screen, so it's easy to see and use, no matter if you're on a small phone or a big computer.</main>
        <section>Because of responsive design, we don't need to make special versions of websites just for phones or tablets. This saves time and money. It also means that when you visit a website on your phone, you don't have to pinch and zoom to read things or scroll a lot to see everything. Everything fits nicely on the screen, so it's easy to read and use.</section>
        <section>Responsive websites also make search engines happy. When a website works well on all devices, search engines like it more and might show it higher in the search results. This is great because more people can find the website easily.</section>
        <section>In simple terms, responsive web design makes websites look good on everything, saves time and money, and helps people find and use websites easily.</section>
